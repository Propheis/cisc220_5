# CISC 220 Assignment 5
Project Repo for CISC 220 Assignment 5

## Assignment Description: 

Write the `universalDoubleLinkeList` program. It defines a linked list that
can hold data of these types `[int, int*, float, float*, char, char*]` using a `Union`.

* Define and Declare the library functions in udll.c and udll.h
* Write the main function in `main.c` that calls all 4 functions with any values you assume.
* Write a makefile to compile and link all files and create the executable

## Assumptions
Please note that we are assuming the name of the executable should be called `universalDoubleLinkedList`. The assignment documentation says `universalDoubleLinkeList`. We are assuming this is a typo.
